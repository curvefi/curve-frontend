/**
 * @file entities/gauge/index.ts
 * @description This is the main entry point for the 'gauge' entity in the FSD architecture.
 * It exports all the necessary components, functions, and types related to gauges in the Curve.fi DApp.
 *
 * This file serves as a centralized export point, making it easier for other parts of the application
 * to import gauge-related functionality without having to know the exact file structure.
 *
 * By using this index file, we maintain a clean and organized structure for the gauge entity,
 * following the principles of FSD.
