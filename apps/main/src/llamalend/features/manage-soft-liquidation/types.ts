/**
 * The types below are based on the types defined in lend.types.ts and loan.types.ts
 * but cannot be imported directly as they reside in the app packages.
 *
 * To maintain clean architecture, we don't want the app package types
 * to depend on these feature-specific types either.
 *
 * While a mapper from app types to feature types could be implemented, for now
 * it's sufficient to manually mirror the necessary types. This allows app objects
 * to be used directly within the feature without additional transformation.
