## Wallet Connect Domain Verification

The [walletconnect.txt](./walletconnect.txt) file contains the token used to verify the domain in the wallet connect dashboard.
This approach only works to validate a single domain at once, however once validated the domain the file is allowed to change.

## Security.txt

The [security.txt](./security.txt) file is used to define security policies and contact information for security researchers.
It follows the [RFC 9116 standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116).

The expiration date should be updated periodically to ensure the file remains valid.
Check the contact information before updating the date to ensure it is still accurate.
