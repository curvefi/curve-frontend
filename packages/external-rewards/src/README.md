- pools: Array of relevant pools/markets
  - `id`: Internal id for you, or `null`
  - `poolId`: Curve pool/market id (found in pool/market url on curve.fi or lend.curve.fi)
  - `campaignStart`: Start of the rewards, as UTC timestamp
  - `campaignEnd`: End of the rewards, as UTC timestamp
  - `poolAddress`: Address of the pool/market (use address identified as `controller` for lending markets)
  - `gaugeAddress`: Address of the gauge, or `null`
  - `network`: Network of the pool/market
  - `multiplier`: Multiplier, or `null`
  - `tags`: Array of pool/market specific tags (any of the tags ids listed here: [`rewards-tags.json`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-frontend/blob/main/packages/external-rewards/src/reward-tags.json))

## Adding an rewards to the list

Conditions the project must meet in order to be added to the list of rewards:

1. It must be live

Easy two-step process for your reward to appear on Curve's websites:

1. You'll need to upload the app/tool's logo to the [`curve-assets` repo](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-assets/tree/main/platforms) (submit a PR there, we'll be notified and will review and merge it). It must be a PNG image of at least 200x200 and at most 500x500 px.
2. Submit a PR in this very repository, adding the app/tool's metadata as described above in the [`campaign-list.json`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-frontend/blob/main/packages/external-rewards/src/campaign-list.json) file and create a new file in the `campaigns` folder for your campaign. You don't have to wait for (1) to be merged to do this. We'll also be notified and will review and merge your PR. _Please provide a very short explanation of how the submitted project fits, if it isn't immediately obvious from the project's metadata in your PR._
