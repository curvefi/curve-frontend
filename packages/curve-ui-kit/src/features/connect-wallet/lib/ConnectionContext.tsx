/**
 * Hacks the eth_accounts RPC method for Cypress tests to return the correct wallet address.
 *
 * **Problem**:
 * - Wagmi with private key accounts (used in Cypress) doesn't expose accounts via eth_accounts
 * - eth_accounts typically returns accounts managed by injected wallets (like MetaMask)
 * - Private key accounts in wagmi/viem must be explicitly passed to actions, not hoisted to provider level
 * - Our curve libraries use ethers BrowserProvider, which calls eth_accounts to determine signer address
 * - This creates a mismatch where ethers can't find the correct signer address
 *
 * **Solution**:
 * Override the provider's eth_accounts response to return the wallet address from the private key account.
 * This bridges the incompatibility between wagmi's private key handling and ethers' expectation
 * that accounts are available through the standard eth_accounts RPC method.
 *
 * @see https://wagmi.sh/vue/guides/viem#private-key-mnemonic-accounts
