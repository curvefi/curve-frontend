     * 1. unstable_connector(injected) - Uses the user's injected wallet for transactions

     *    According to Wagmi docs, it is highly recommended to use unstable_connector
     *    inside a fallback transport because connector requests may fail due to:
     *    - Chain ID mismatches
     *    - Limited RPC method support
     *    - Rate-limiting of wallet provider
     *
     * 2. http transport - Used as fallback when connector transport fails
     *    - Configured with batch size of 3 to comply with DRPC free tier limits
     *    - Prevents error code 29 from exceeding batch limits
     *
     * Note: WalletConnect ignores this http endpoint and uses chain.rpcUrls.default.http[0]
     * regardless of the configuration here.
