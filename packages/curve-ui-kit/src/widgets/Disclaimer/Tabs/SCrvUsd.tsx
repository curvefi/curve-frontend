      <Paragraph>{t`The accuracy of scrvUSD supply calculations is crucial for the proper distribution of protocol revenue among holders. Users should be aware that supply calculations may be subject to manipulation through MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategies, which could affect revenue distribution and, consequently, the actual yields received by scrvUSD holders. This can lead to discrepancies between expected and actually received yields for users. From a practical standpoint, when evaluating potential scrvUSD yields, users should consider that published APYs may differ from actual returns due to these factors.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`scrvUSD accounts for MEV risk by incorporating protections that calculate a Time Weighted Average (TWA) of the ratio between deposited crvUSD in the Vault and total circulating supply of crvUSD. The TWA is meant to prevent MEV manipulation of the yield distribution rate. Misconfiguration of the TWA can allow MEV actions to become profitable. Any manipulation gain or loss is shared with all the other vault depositors until a new non-manipulated snapshot is taken.`}</Paragraph>

    <Header>{t`Cross-chain scrvUSD Risks`}</Header>
    <Section>
      <Paragraph>{t`While scrvUSD can be bridged, cross-chain representations lack the method to return its continuously updating price. Therefore cross-chain scrvUSD incorporates a series of additional contracts that provide and validate Ethereum block hashes, using those to calculate and store the current rate.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`There are operational requirements to reliably transmit the rate data, including to apply and prove block hashes. While these actions are permissionless, they may not be closely monitored or reliably executed. Assuming that cross-chain contracts are bug free, execution is programmatic and therefore safe; this point regarding monitoring is rather a liveness concern.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`Furthermore, there is a trust assumption in the owner of the scrvUSD oracle which can update the prover address and rate limiting parameters. Due to these factors, the scrvUSD rate on chains other than mainnet may not accurately reflect the actual rate, either temporarily or permanently.`}</Paragraph>
    </Section>

    <Header>{t`Secondary Market Risks`}</Header>
    <Section>
      <Paragraph>{t`scrvUSD can also be acquired on secondary markets outside of the primary access venue (and cross-chain scrvUSD is only available on secondary markets). As a consequence of certain market scenarios, scrvUSD may trade at a discount to its underlying crvUSD value. Users who sell scrvUSD at such a discounted price will realize losses relative to its intrinsic value. Secondary market dynamics are subject to external factors, including market sentiment, trading volume, and liquidity conditions, which may amplify these risks.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`As scrvUSD is always readily redeemable for crvUSD directly from the vault contract, aside from a technical failure, users should never be required to swap at unfavorable rates on secondary markets. Situations may occur that DEX aggregators fail to route trades optimally, so users should always check that their aggregator service is quoting sensible exchange rates. Furthermore, being able to redeem crvUSD from an L2 requires the user to be able to bridge back to mainnet. Redemptions of cross-chain scrvUSD may incur additional gas costs and dependence on bridge availability.`}</Paragraph>
