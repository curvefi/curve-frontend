      <Paragraph>
        {t`Collateralized debt positions are managed passively through arbitrage opportunities: if the collateral's price decreases, the system automatically sells off collateral to arbitrageurs in a ‘soft-liquidation mode’. If the collateral's price increases, the system recovers the collateral. This algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust the collateral backing each crvUSD in real-time, responding to fluctuating market conditions. While this approach is intended to mitigate the severity of traditional liquidations—a process where collateral becomes insufficient, leading to irreversible sales at potentially undervalued prices—it does not eliminate the inherent risk of collateral volatility.

      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>{t`Borrowers in the crvUSD ecosystem are subject to specific risks associated with the liquidation process. It is crucial to understand that if the User’s collateral is placed into soft-liquidation mode, they are prohibited from withdrawing the collateral or augmenting their position with additional collateral. Entering soft-liquidation mode locks the collateral, removing the option to withdraw or add to it. In case market conditions suggest a strategic adjustment to the User’s position, they may face exacerbated risk due to such restrictions.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`Users should be cautious about collateral management, as a sharp decline in the price of the collateral within a brief period can escalate losses, further deteriorating the health of the loan. Respectively, an increase in the collateral's value while in soft-liquidation can also cause “de-liquidation losses” - a situation where an appreciating market price for the collateral may negatively impact the loan’s health. During periods of high volatility and/or high Ethereum gas prices, arbitrage may be less efficient, causing losses incurred from soft liquidation to be exacerbated.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`If the health of the loan falls to zero, the position is subject to hard liquidation, which is an irreversible process resulting in the loss of the collateral with no possibility of recovery or de-liquidation. This scenario underscores the critical need for risk management when using leverage. Leverage and collateral management should be approached with caution, reflecting a balanced assessment of potential gains against the risk of significant financial loss.`}</Paragraph>

        {t`Curve incorporates specialized on-chain Exponential Moving Average (EMA) oracles built into stabelswap-ng, tricrypto-ng, and twocrypto-ng Curve pool implementations. crvUSD markets derive price information from a select number of high TVL Curve pools. By utilizing the EMA smoothing methodology, oracles mitigate the impact of transient price fluctuations, aiming to reduce unnecessary losses caused by short-term market volatility or attempts to manipulate the oracle. Despite the manipulation-resistant design specification, Curve pool oracles may exhibit price distortions in certain scenarios that have the potential to result in missed or excessive liquidations. This may be a result of liquidity and volume migration to alternate venues that increase the risk of oracle manipulation. A detailed explanation of the aforementioned terms can be found in the`}{' '}

These contracts reference a subset of whitelisted stablecoins as a proxy for the intended USD price. Instability affecting any counterparty Pegkeeper assets (e.g. USDT, USDC), which are also used to aggregate a USD price for crvUSD, may cause the Pegkeeper to deposit all of its crvUSD into the pool in an attempt to rebalance. This creates a dependency on the Pegkeeper counterparty assets that determines the stability of the crvUSD peg. An upgraded PegkeeperV2 design promises to alleviate this risk.`}</Paragraph>

Such scenarios can significantly impact the proper functioning of the stablecoin market, particularly concerning the process of liquidation.`}</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>{t`crvUSD relies on liquidity concentrated within particular Pegkeeper pools, which serve a dual purpose as both a source of liquidity and price feeds for crvUSD oracles. If the incentives for depositing crvUSD into these pools are insufficient, the liquidity shortfalls can result in missed liquidations or deflationary price spirals (cascading liquidations). This phenomenon occurs when initial liquidations fail to be executed effectively, leading to a domino effect of further liquidations and potentially rapid, significant decreases in asset prices.`}</Paragraph>
